### Hi there! I'm Kenneth! ðŸ‘‹

Located in the Metro Detroit Area. I've graduated from Flatiron School's Software Engineering Live bootcamp. Experienced with Javascript, React, and Ruby on Rails with a background in Video Content Creation.

I have a higher interest in Frontend Development, but I absolutely love working in fullstack! I'm always searching to improve my skillset and learn new languages.
